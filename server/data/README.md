# Data

This directory contains scripts and tools for ingesting data from the NYC
Campaign Finance Board and the annotations table.

These commands are run on an ad-hoc basis.

## data/annotations

The annotations command reads annotations from Airtable and upserts
into the database.

## data/cfb

The cfb command reads contribution data from the CFB and inserts into
the database.
